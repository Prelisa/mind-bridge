# MindBridge - Project Summary

## 1. Objective and Functionality

MindBridge is a content publishing platform designed to empower users to create, publish, and share their articles, blog posts, and ideas. The platform aims to provide an intuitive and streamlined user experience for content creators while maintaining a clean and responsive interface for readers.

### Key Functionality:

- **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login system with JWT-based authentication
- **Content Creation**: Rich text editor with formatting options for creating engaging content
- **Post Management**: Dashboard interface for creating, editing, and deleting posts
- **User Profiles**: Basic profile information with description
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface that adapts to different screen sizes

The platform focuses on simplicity and ease of use, allowing writers to focus on their content rather than dealing with complex publishing tools. The rich text editor powered by Quill provides essential formatting capabilities while maintaining a clean user interface.

### Component Architecture:

1. **Frontend (React)**
   - Pages (Login, Signup, Dashboard, Post Editor)
   - Components (Header, Footer, PostCard)
   - API integration services
   - State management

2. **Backend (Node.js/Express)**
   - Authentication controllers
   - Post management controllers
   - MongoDB connection
   - JWT middleware for route protection

3. **Database (MongoDB)**
   - User collection
   - Posts collection

## 3. Tools and Frameworks Used

### Frontend
- **React.js**: Main frontend library for building the user interface
- **React Router DOM**: For client-side routing
- **React Bootstrap**: For UI components and responsive design
- **Quill.js**: Rich text editor for post creation
- **Axios**: For handling HTTP requests to the backend
- **JWT-Decode**: For decoding JWT tokens on client-side

### Backend
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side code
- **Express.js**: Web framework for handling routes and requests
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB interaction
- **JWT (jsonwebtoken)**: For authentication and session management
- **CORS**: For handling cross-origin requests

### Database
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud database service for storing user and post data

### Development Tools
- **NPM**: Package manager
- **Nodemon**: Development server for auto-reloading
- **Git**: Version control
